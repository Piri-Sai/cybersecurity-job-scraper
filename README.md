# Cybersecurity Job Market Analytics â€“ Final Year Project

This project explores the UK cybersecurity job market using real data from CWJobs.co.uk.  
It focuses exclusively on identifying the most in-demand **technical skills** by analyzing job descriptions.

---

## Objectives

- Automate job scraping using Python
- Extract and clean technical skills from job descriptions
- Visualize the most frequently mentioned skills
- Help students and new professionals understand real industry demand

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (`selenium`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)
- CWJobs.co.uk (job data source)
- Visual Studio Code
- GitHub (project version control)


---

## Reflections

- CWJobs data is dynamic, real-world, and sometimes incomplete
- Some skills are general (like "Incident Response"), others tool-specific (like "Azure", "Splunk")
- Even with 25 jobs, patterns like SIEM and cloud security tools emerged clearly
